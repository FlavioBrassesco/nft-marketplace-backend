# TODO

- setup an event based caching mechanism (blockchain event listener + instant record when doing transactions via marketplace)
- setup a cache middleware for common view requests (redis?)
- authorized-marketplace model and approved token model are not needed (data should be hardcoded onchain and cached)
- Parse JSON from tokenURI and contractURI
- Paginate blockchain requests
